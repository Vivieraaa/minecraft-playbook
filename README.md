# Minecraft 1.20.1 Server Playbook

**What is?**

It's my first time writing a playbook, so I'm learning as I go. This will be my attempt at translating an exisitng minecraft server into a playbook. üôè

## How to use.

**Needed:**

- Ubuntu Server 22.04.3 LTS
- Forge 1.20.1-47.1.0 for Minecraft 1.20.1 server files in /mcserver/foxxolay
- Ansible

**Steps:**

1. Setup forge server files with mods and configs.
2. Add desired destination server to inventory file.
3. Run ansible playbook against server.
4. To update mods and configs, delete world file from file source files and then run the playbook again.

### Possible Changes/Updats

- add variables
- reorganize for easier setup
- figure out mod and config updating easier
- possible for other mc server versions as well
